# todo: Make two different integers here:

# todo: add the two integers and save the sum to a variable named "added"
print("Adding the two numbers resulted in: " + str(added))

# todo: now do the same thing but subtract the two numbers, save them to a variable names "subtracted"
print("Subtracting the numbers resulted in: " + str(subtracted))

# todo: do the same as above, just multiply the numbers, save to "multiplied"
print("Multiplying the numbers resulted in: " + str(multiplied))

# todo: divide the numbers, make sure the denominator is not zero! Save to "divided"
print("Dividing the numbers resulted in: " + str(divided))

# todo: now we are going to do something new, it's the modulus divider. The modulus returns
# the remainder of a division operation. For example 7 % 3 will be 1. Because 3, 6 then there
# is one more to get to 7. Save the modulus between your two variables as "modulus"
print("The modulus of the numbers resulted in: " + str(modulus))

# todo: You can do an exponent by doing **, if you did 2^3 power, this is 2 * 2 * 2 (two times itself 3 times)
# save the exponent of your variables as "exponent"
print("The exponent of the two numbers resulted in: " + str(exponent))

# todo: The last operator we will go over is floor division. This is division that returns a whole number (integer)
# floor division does division but lobs off the decimal. Kind of like 4/3 is 1.33333. Floor division takes
# off the .33333 part and just returns 1. Do floor division with // then save it to "floor_division"
print("The floor division of the two numbers resulted in: " + str(floor_division))
