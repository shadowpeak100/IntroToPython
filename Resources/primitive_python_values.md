# Primitive Values

Python, like most all programing languages has primitive values.
These allow you to store data in your program and are different 
based off what you are storing. Let's go through a few:

### Integer

What in the world is an integer? This is easy! You
see these all over the place. An integer is a whole number
just like 1, 2, 9, 14862. If it's a whole number it's best 
to be represented with an integer.

```
apples_I_Ate = 100

~ To force this to be a integer (not required):

apples_I_Ate: int = 100
```

### Float

Similar to integers floats also store numbers. Examples here
are 3.1415, 9.8, 13.26, 66.45 and so on. Notice the difference? 
Floating point numbers or floats store a number with a decimal.

```
science_grade = 98.6

~ To force this to be a float (again, not required):

science_grade: float = 98.6
```

### Boolean

True. False. That's almost all you need to know for this one. 
A boolean can only be these two different values. You could use it
like: did I pass the test? True! Or false if you didn't study...

```angular2html
passed_test = True

~ If you want to force this to be a boolean:

passed_test: bool = True
```

### String

The last primitive type in Python is the string. This is like your 
name. It stores a word, or a sentence. It could be the entire 
Declaration of Independence.

```
my_name = "Brayden"

~ Or if you want to be really assertive, you can 
say "This must be a string!" like below. This forces
the value to be a string.

myName: str = "Brayden"
```
