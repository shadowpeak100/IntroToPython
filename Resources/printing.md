# Printing

Python allows you to print something to the console. What is the console
you may ask? The console is text output that a program
can produce. When you use the print function, the output
will be displayed on the console

## How to print

Python context is simple here, simply state what you want to be
printed inside of the print function. This will pass
that value to the system and tell it to print:

```
print("My name is MODOK")
```

This will print out the *string* (more on what a string
is later) "My name is MODOK". Try this on your own!
