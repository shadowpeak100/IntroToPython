# Operations on Variables

### Addition
If you have 2 variables X and Y, you can add them
with X + Y. If you want to save this you can do so
with the = operator. For example:

```
sum = x + y
```

### Subtraction
Similar to addition, you can subtract 2 variables using the
"-" operator, assigning the result with "="

```
subtractedAmount = x - y
```

### Multiplication
To do multiplication use "*"

```
product = x * y
```

### Division
Division uses "/"

```
division = x / y
```

### Modulus
A modulus expression return the remainder from doing 
division. Some division produces a number with a decimal.
For example 4/3 is 1.33333. If you did division by hand, 
you would find this is 1 with a remainder of 1. Modulus
returns that remainder amount. Modulus uses "%" 

```
modulus = x % y
```

### Exponent
An exponent multiplies a number my itself a number
of times. Use "**" to represent exponents. 2 ** 3 can
also be written as 2 * 2 * 2

```
exponent = x ** y
```

### Floor Division
Floor division takes the result of vision and cuts off
the decimal. Similar to above, the floor vision product
of 4 // 3 is just 1 (1.33333 becomes 1). Use "//"

```
floor_division = x // y
```
